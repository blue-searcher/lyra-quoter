# Lyra-quoter

Inspired by [Lyra SDK](https://github.com/lyra-finance/lyra-js)

##### Notes:
- Might not have proper checks (already expired option for example)
- This is not intended to be used on-chain
- totalPremium already takes into account fees
- totalFee is `optionPriceFee + spotPriceFee + vegaFee + varianceFee`
